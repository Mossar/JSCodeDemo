REST Consumption
====================

This example shows my Angular 1.5 way to do standard requests to REST Api in Groovy/Grails.
Standard $http service is overriden by my RestService, controller manages all the actions and service is responsible for calling API requests.

====================

Here you can see example of handling registering.
AuthService contains code responsible for API requests. In controller you can see functions which are used by form stored in register.html.

I also attached working example in index.html where game elements are stored with config.js describing those objects and game.js dealing with logic.
